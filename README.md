# Furiosa 3D Poster Animation

## Overview

This project demonstrates a 3D animated poster for the upcoming movie *Furiosa*. The poster uses HTML, CSS, and custom web fonts to create an immersive and interactive visual experience, featuring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, directed by George Miller. The animation gives the poster a dynamic feel, rotating and moving in 3D space, which enhances the overall aesthetic.

## Features

- **3D Animation**: The poster utilizes CSS keyframe animations to rotate in 3D space, providing an engaging visual effect.
- **Custom Fonts**: The project uses custom fonts loaded via `@font-face`, specifically the "Agency FB" font family in various weights, to achieve a cinematic feel.
- **Responsive Design**: The poster adapts to different screen orientations, scaling down slightly in landscape mode for an optimal viewing experience.
- **Dynamic Text Effects**: Text elements have a unique look with textured backgrounds and blending modes, enhancing their appearance.
